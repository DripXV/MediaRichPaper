<p><font color="green"><h2>COMMENT</h2></font>In this video, you see a zombie walking in the house and starts eating the the person inside the house. Once the zombie enters the house, you can hear a horror piano vibe and 
you can hear the scream at the end. That is the death drive. The death drive is the will to survive and avoiding death. For me, I do not want to keep on hearing that sound and the screaming. 
For me to avoid that I need to beat that level. If I beat the game I am free from death drive. This is the part where you won't hear the horror sound and the scream.
At the same time you feel the joyfulness that you were successful. Lindley was discussing about the joy of success.</p><p>
<font color="green"><h2>QUOTE FROM THE READINGS</h2></font>Anzieu- "the result is a defusing of the drives, freeing the death drives and giving them economic pedominance over the
life drive."
Lindley- "triumphing over obstacles, the joy is success, victory."<font color="green"><h2>CITATION</h2></font><font color=green>(Didier, Anzieu, "The Sound Envelope" in "he Skin Ego", pg. 169)
